		<description><![CDATA[What a great post. I loved reading about the experience with the rocks. Funny, I&#039;d always gone to the Sedgwick to look at the dinosaurs but I will now look at those rocks as well with new eyes! Did you see the upside-down statue buried outside the museum with only the feet visible? That&#039;s great too. I also like your phrase at the end, with the &#039;stone&#039;s throw&#039; metaphor. Thanks! Will you be writing more museum visit reports??]]></description>
