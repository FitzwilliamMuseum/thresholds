Have watched the Livestream again and enjoyed it even more. My earlier comment about the camera angle was a fault on my computer and not yours.How I wish I could have been there!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for the wonderful end event to the Thresholds project. Hearing all ten poems on the site of the conception of one of them, and listening to all warm words of the speakers, each loving poetry in their own way, made for a memorable finale. I am all the more curious about next editions now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rachel/Helen
Have just watched the Livestream---brilliant idea!  (camera perhaps not quite adjusted?) So sorry not to have been there.
Sadly I missed the film. Presumably I can recall it? Obviously this project has proved to be utterly successful! What next?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is only recently that I have discovered Cambridge ‘proper’.  Aside from the array of student societies are the offerings of a dynamic, cultural City.  These have been the highlights of my past term, affording the brightest mix of people, histories and backgrounds.
Through the wonderful Thresholds initiative, my term has been marked by a poetry workshop in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology with Daljit Nagra.  The project, which celebrates ten poets in residence at the University of Cambridge Museums and Collections, regularly holds poetry readings.  At a brilliantly energised recital by Gillian Clarke at the University Library, I sat next to a lady who by day is a waitress, and by night an avid reader, currently embarking on her first novel. 
Slowly, I am getting around the museums, reading, writing and listening as I go.]]></description>
