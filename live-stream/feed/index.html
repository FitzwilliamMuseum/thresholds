Have watched the Livestream again and enjoyed it even more. My earlier comment about the camera angle was a fault on my computer and not yours.How I wish I could have been there!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for the wonderful end event to the Thresholds project. Hearing all ten poems on the site of the conception of one of them, and listening to all warm words of the speakers, each loving poetry in their own way, made for a memorable finale. I am all the more curious about next editions now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rachel/Helen
Have just watched the Livestream---brilliant idea!  (camera perhaps not quite adjusted?) So sorry not to have been there.
Sadly I missed the film. Presumably I can recall it? Obviously this project has proved to be utterly successful! What next?]]></description>
